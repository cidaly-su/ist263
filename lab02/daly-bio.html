    <h1>Ciara's Biography</h1>
    <h2>Personal Info</h2>
    <p>
    I’m a marketing and retail management major in Whitman, with a minor in information technology and management in the iSchool. I’m <strong>interested</strong> in fashion and digital marketing and thought my minor would help me succeed with my interest. Recently I’ve accomplished securing a summer internship with Target as a store executive, as well as being elected as the new member educator for my sorority. My strongest skills are public speaking, teamwork, interpersonal skills, and problem solving. Outside of school and work I really enjoy hanging out with my friends and family, listening to music, exercising, and baking.
