<p class="intro">
    Ever since my earliest memory I was always playing a sport. It first started with soccer, then 
moved into basketball and softball and then lacrosse started becoming popular in Long Island. I was 
balancing playing lacrosse and softball in the same season in third grade, and after that spring I decided, I was going to stop playing softball, and continue playing lacrosse. As the years went on lacrosse was really becoming an emerging sport throughout the country. In 5th grade I started playing travel lacrosse and my weekends and summers were consumed with traveling to different states to play in lacrosse tournaments. <br>
<br>

As I entered high school, I was used to wearing athletic or leisure wear most of my time. I did have an interest in fashion but didn’t invest much time or money into it because I was playing sports every day. After I decided to not play college lacrosse and entered college, I realized I didn’t have many hobbies or interest besides sports. My freshman year of college when I came to school, I discovered a different type of style people were dressing in from what I was used to wearing skinny jeans and tube tops. When we got sent home for COVID TikTok became popular and I started discovering a lot of fashion and beauty trends. 
When I noticed I had a lot of interest in them I started watching more and more TikToks of fashion and 
beauty influencers, as well as going on Pinterest a lot. This evolving fashion hobby of mine has helped me 
express my personality a lot more. I'm very happy I was able to find a passion that I enjoyed after I stopped playing sports, which you can learn about on my other pages!
